You’re aiming at the end of the rainbow
Didn’t they tell you that’s just a loosing game
You’re reaching for goals to achieve and
Relinquish your demons but their the only thing real
Lately you’ve been loosing yourself here
Don’t feel any pain
Let yourself slip away
Into the dark
Into the dark
Lately you’ve been ill
There’s nothing to say
When I run away
Into the dark
Into the dark
Into the dark
Darkness
Can’t find no shade in the darkness
Can’t see your face in the darkness
You’re loosing yourself in the darkness
Keep painting all the streets ivory white
You want it all clean right?
This just a loosing game
No cheating that’s what you ought to teach
Gave up just to be grieving
Now you can’t go back
Into the dark
Into the dark
Darkness
Can’t find no shade in the darkness
Can’t see your face in the darkness
You’re loosing yourself in the darkness
Darkness
Can’t find no shade in the darkness
Can’t see your face in the darkness
You’re loosing yourself in the darkness
